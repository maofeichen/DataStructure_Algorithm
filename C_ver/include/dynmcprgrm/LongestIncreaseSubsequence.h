 *
 * An implementation of the longest increasing subsequence problem. 
 * There are two approaches to solve this problem as far as I know:
 * one is via the dynamic programming, it runs at O(n^2) time; the 
 * other is a customize approach, runs at O(nlogn) time. I first 
 * would like to implement the dp approach.
